# Bank Customer Segmentation

## Project Overview

Our team undertook this project to segment bank customers into different clusters using unsupervised learning techniques. By understanding and analyzing customer data, we aim to identify distinct groups of customers, which can help in targeted marketing, personalized services, and improved customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement

As data scientists for a bank, we use unsupervised learning to segment the customers into clusters. This involves:

- Understanding and learning the dataset.
- Cleaning the data as thoroughly as possible.
- Analyzing the data extensively and visualizing insights.
- Building machine learning models to cluster customers.
- After clustering, analyzing why each sample in the same cluster is similar and how each cluster differs from the others.
- (Bonus) Feature selection and engineering.
- (Bonus) Using Plotly for visualizations.

## Dataset

The dataset contains various attributes of bank customers that will be used for clustering. The details of the dataset are included in the notebook.

## Project Structure

- `Bank_Customer_Segmentation.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis, data cleaning, visualizations, and clustering models.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Bank_Customer_Segmentation.git
    cd Bank_Customer_Segmentation
    ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells


## Analysis and Visualization

- **Data Cleaning**: The data is cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Detailed analysis and visualization of the data to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
- **Clustering Models**: Various clustering algorithms (such as K-means, DBSCAN) are implemented and evaluated.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Post-clustering analysis to interpret and understand the characteristics of each cluster.

## Future Work

- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to improve the clustering results.
- **Advanced Visualization**: Using Plotly for interactive visualizations.
